    """
    Implementation of the single pseudo label (SPL) approach.
    Do NOT change the interface of this function. For benchmarking we expect the given inputs and
    return values. Introduce additional helper functions if desired.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x_train : array, shape (n_samples, n_features). The feature vectors for training.
    y_train : array, shape (n_samples,). The ground truth labels of samples x.

    Returns
    -------
    spl_predict_fn :
        Callable, a function that holds a reference to your trained estimator and uses it to
        predict class labels and scores for the incoming test data.

        Parameters
        ----------
        x_test : array, shape (n_test_samples, n_features). The feature vectors for testing.

        Returns
        -------
        y_pred :    array, shape (n_samples,). The predicted class labels.
        y_score :   array, shape (n_samples,).
                    The similarities or confidence scores of the predicted class labels. We assume
                    that the scores are confidence/similarity values, i.e., a high value indicates
                    that the class prediction is trustworthy.
                    To be more precise:
                    - Returning probabilities in the range 0 to 1 is fine if 1 means high
                      confidence.
                    - Returning distances in the range -inf to 0 (or +inf) is fine if 0 (or +inf)
                      means high confidence.

                    Please ensure that your score is formatted accordingly.
